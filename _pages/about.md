I am a PhD student in Queen Mary University of London, working with [Shanxin Yuan](https://shanxinyuan.github.io/) and [Greg Slabaugh](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~gslabaugh/). Previously, I was a Senior Algorithm Engineer at Ant Group based in Hangzhou, working with [Yuan Cheng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drchengyuan/). Before joining Ant Group, I obtained my Master degree from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.

My work mainly focuses on computer vision including object detection, video action detection, video representation learning, large-scale video-language pre-training, and human-motion generation.
